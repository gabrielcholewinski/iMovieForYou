# iMovieForYou

The goal of the project is to develop a cloud native application that offers a set of services that provide relevant information extracted from a dataset. The services will be provided through a REST API and should be organized in two sets: user-oriented and administrator-oriented.

This project offers a type of service for fun, information and comfort for a user who likes to watch a lot of movies, series, documentaries, TV shows, among others. iMovieForYou centralizes and makes available information about the various titles so that a user can consult them, and even have personally relevant information and recommendations based on the genres of the titles the user has watched.

The Dataset contains all the movies on the IMDB website up to the year 2019 (https://www.kaggle.com/ashirwadsangwan/imdb-dataset). It is divided into 5 tables that characterize everything from the titles to the people who participated in their production (actors, directors, etc).
